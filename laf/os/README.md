# LAF OS Library

`os` is an abstraction layer to access in different way the Operating
System graphics interface. We have our own implementation to create
windows and handle mouse/keyboard input. The graphics are rendered
using the [Skia](https://skia.org/) library.

Minimum platforms:

* Windows Vista
* macOS 10.9
