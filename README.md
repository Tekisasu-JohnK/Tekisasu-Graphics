# Tekisasu Graphics

This is a private soft fork of Aseprite used by Tekisasu for the development of Poncho Poncho Land.  This fork ensures that each sprite project file in our game is matched with specific builds we create of Aseprite.  We do not redistribute binary builds to the public.  Please purchase a license from the good folks at Aseprite, support their amazing project and use the versions they sell and distribute.
